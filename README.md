# Stocks Dashboard

This repo houses a PowerBI `.pbix` file that is used to create a Self Updating Dashboard for NYSE Stock Tickers. When this PowerBI file is hosted it will make daily HTTP Requests to the Yahoo Finance API thus always keeping the dashboard up to date. This same lesser used connection method can be used to utilize thousands of free API Datasources. To use this file, download the [`Stock Analysis.pbix`](Stock&#32;Analysis.pbix) file and host it with a PowerBI Account.
